Exploratory Data Analysis on a white wine dataset

This is my first project about Exploratory Data Analysis using R. I investigated a set of white wine data in view of relationships between wine Quality and other chemical properties.

The RMD file has the R code used to create the HTML in R Markdown format.

The original dataset is available at the link below.
